        Transpilers: 
            1) React uses transpilers 
            2) Transpilers are those which convert one type of syntax  to another type (eg: Babel)
            3) Basically in react what happens is that we write code in jsx form , but it is converted to react code (eg: see first-app -> src -> app.js)
